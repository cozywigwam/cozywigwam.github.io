Are we [legitimate]? Let's try a quick test. `$ Oh, shall we?` Yes, we shall!

[legitimate]: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html "World Wide Web"

    takePicture() {
        // make it happen
    }
    tossCat() {
        takePicture();
    }
    flyPlane() {
        tossCat();
    }
    
The `// make it happen` part always seems easy from the brainstorming couch. (Especially if the brainstormer isn't a doer, as I once overheard.)

## H2 Brings the Noise

``` bash
# 80 char fixed-width test
12345678902234567890323456789042345678905234567890623456789072345678908234567890
```

### Additional Tests

While we’re at it, we might as well kick the tires on a list.

- Extraordinary
- Plain
- Semantics
- Over-thinking, or is it under-thinking? And supposing there was a final judgement of some sort, who would adjudicate? Regardless, I just wanted enough copy to wrap these here lines
- Ambivalence

Let’s not spoil the list with ungraceul exit spacing. Like $laptop, this makes me think of another term I found from Jekyll: “vertical-rhythm.”

# zomg h1

It's a heading round-up.

## Terrible twos

Dumb paragraphs always gettin' in the way.

### Third Time is a Whatever

#### Fore

##### Hit Me a Five Spot

###### Asterisk Melee

Well that was anticlimactic.
