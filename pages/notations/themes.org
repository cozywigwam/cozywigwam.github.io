[[https://github.com/cozywigwam/poly][Poly]] is a deviation from Chris
Kempson's
[[https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme][tomorrow-night-eighties]].

It works on macOS in terminal/tmux. See
[[https://github.com/cozywigwam/poly][github]] for TrueColor and
=termguicolors= considerations. The following will tame tmux:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # ~/.tmux.conf

    set -g status-bg '#202020'
    set -g status-fg '#555555'
    set -g window-status-bg default
    set -g window-status-fg default
    set -g window-status-current-bg '#202020'
    set -g window-status-current-fg '#ff8c94'
    set -g pane-border-style fg='#000000'
    set -g pane-active-border-style fg='#000000'
#+END_EXAMPLE

To make the [[https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline][airline]]
styles match, I created a
[[https://gist.github.com/cozywigwam/e6e0572c6d6529df3eceaaba205c87ac][poly-coordinated
variation]] (derived from
[[https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes/blob/master/autoload/airline/themes/bubblegum.vim][bubblegum]]).
It goes in =~/.vim/autoload/airline/themes=.

As a warning, this theme is hacky. It is built on top of
[[https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-tomorrow][sanityinc-tomorrow-eighties]]
(which is great), and it doesn't follow best practices.

With that being said, though, it is a functioning and extended port of
Poly. It includes dired, man, magit, helm, eshell, org, grep/ag, and
front-end modes.

I use a
[[https://gist.github.com/cozywigwam/8cf85615375699ede084b500cd410b93][base16
eighties]] theme with the background slightly modified
([[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2][original]]).
