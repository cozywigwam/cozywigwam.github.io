Welcome to Sunflower Sea Star. It is the tech center for my creation arms.

The Anti-Authority is soon forthcoming, and Polyambidextrous is on hiatus.

While on a road trip a few years ago, I decided to give some of my interests their own arenas for exploration and growth. (Here's a random picture from the road trip.)

This site, Sunflower Sea Star, has received the most of my attention, although it admittedly doesn't look like much.  :)  It started as a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> site. It became my collection of notes and keyboard shortcuts, reminders, and snippets. I'd like to polish the content to the point of being useful to others, but until then, it'll remain more of a personal notebook than anything, I suppose.

Currently, this site is written with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, using <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby" target="_blank">Gatsby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components" target="_blank">Styled Components</a>. I accidentally tried this new drug call <a href="http://spacemacs.org/" target="_blank">Spacemacs</a> and made unexpected new friends like <a href="http://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">org-mode</a>. Some of the content in the site is written in markdown, and some is written in org.

For me, striving to understand computer systems better and working to interface with them more efficiently have always felt intertwined. My last couple years have had a slight detour in that direction, and I'm now returning to the more visual side of things.

I'm on <a href="https://twitter.com/cozywigwam" target="_blank" alt="Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cozywigwam" target="_blank" alt="GitHub">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantsurratt" target="_blank" alt="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.
