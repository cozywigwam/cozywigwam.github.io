Are legitimate desktop ( `$laptop` , as jekyll likes to call it) screen sizes accommodating 80 character widths for code sections? Let’s begin this purposeful journey that wears clothes of silly words.

##Heading h2 for my Character Test

```
# 80 char fixed-width test
12345678902234567890323456789042345678905234567890623456789072345678908234567890
```

###Additional Tests

While we’re at it, we might as well kick the tires on a list.

- Extraordinary
- Plain
- Semantics
- Over-thinking, or is it under-thinking? And supposing there was a final judgement of     some sort, who would adjudicate? Regardless, I just wanted enough copy to wrap
- Ambivalence

Let’s not spoil the list with ungraceul exit spacing. Like $laptop, this makes me think of another term I found from Jekyll: “vertical-rhythm.”

This all seems so dreadfully boring, but then again, I could not bring myself to erect yet another 21st century monument to Lorem Ipsum Brutalism. And I didn’t want to keep this local only, because someone else might want a markdown style guide/test, right?
