### Notes

when bringing in raster art to trace into vector, set the layer to "template" (with "dimmed" opacity)

after pulling in or line-drawing art, start by correcting various fills & strokes

- selecting refers to structure, targeting refers to presentation (you select paths, target appearances)

- with the pen, opt + click the just-made point to make a redirection (instead of continued curve)


- for inner substroke, use offset path

- after using an effect, use Object -> expand appearance to make anchor points conform
