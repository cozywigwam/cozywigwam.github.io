use `.js`, not `.jsx`

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3582#issuecomment-89411479
FWIW, we've never really advocated using .jsx files. We use .js and most (all?) of our open source projects follow this convention. What people are actually doingâ€¦ that's may not match. But I think as transpiling JS becomes more and more common-place, it makes sense to just use .js.


Question:
What is the difference between:
  <a onClick={this.handleClickCloseNav}>test</a>
and:
  <a onClick={this.handleClickCloseNav()}>test</a>
and:
  <a onClick={this.handleClickCloseNav().bind(this)}>test</a>
?
