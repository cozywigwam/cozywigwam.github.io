Welcome. Thank you for visiting this site. ☺︎ My name is Grant Surratt, and I'm a digial creator in San Francisco. At a glance:

- a happy person
- passionate about using computers to make things
- hungry brain

My background is front-end, and I use my family of websites as explorations into adjacent areas: server setup and configuration, design, social integration, etc. Current focuses include JavaScript, Linux/Unix, Vim, and Illustrator.

The Polyambidextrous family is:

- [Polyambidextrous] - frontispiece; aggregate
- [Sinistrocular] - photography, especially of birds
- [Cyan-Eyed Vireo] - composition
- [Sunflower Sea Star] - the technical side of things (this site)
- [The Anti-Authority] - future home of an unneeded dictionary

Social:

- [LinkedIn]
- [Twitter]

I'm an upbeat and cheerful person. My other interests include speedcubing, poetry, armchair philosophy, sometimes pinball, and more birds. Since moving to SF from NY, I've been having fun trying to learn to surf. I prefer open knowledge, reality checks, and optimism to negativity, pretension, and opacity.

I find tremendous inspiration from others across the web, and I would like to say thanks to those who operate on a high level and share so much with others. In particular:
