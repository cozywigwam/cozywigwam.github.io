Welcome. Thank you for visiting this site. ☺︎ My name is Grant Surratt, and I'm a digial creator in San Francisco. At a glance:

- upbeat, cheerful
- passionate about using computers to make things
- hungry brain

I grew up as a classical pianist. Like many youth, the romantics led my soul into early adulthood. Nowadays I'm a tad more conservative, with special interest in J. S. Bach's French Suites, for instance. I enjoy writing and playing music, although I don't perform much (other than privately) these days. Please take a listen to some of my work at [Cyan-Eyed Vireo](https://soundcloud.com/cyaneyedvireo) if you're interested.

After a performance degree, I worked through a few different industries: orthopedics (as a shelf-stocker, but I did set up a simple computer system for them to track their hospital inventories), insurance (with management experience), IT (sales), teaching (LSAT prep), and photography. After a lay-off, I picked up an HTML/CSS book to see what I'd missed since creating websites in my teens.

<em>
Sidebar: In the nineties, I received a cease-and-desist letter from Cumberland Packaging Corporation for trademark abuse. My friend and I had rapper monikers of "Homely-K" and "Sweet-N-Low." (We did not rap. We just had monikers.) My character, Sweet-N-Low, was accompanied by a hand drawn Sweet-N-Low packet in MS Paint. In the website (I think it might have been Geocities..?), we had mock interviews where people discussed space aliens, Elvis, and peanut butter. No mentions of sweeteners. Regardless, the site now resides on a 3.5", not the internet.
</em>

Much had changed. First of all, there was this thing called CSS. And tag names were lowercase. And there was this other thing called JavaScript. I got up to speed, made a site for a buddy, got some small gigs for a political candidate and a surveillance systems contractor, then joined a wonderful agency in Atlanta, [Toolbox No. 9](http://www.toolbox9.com/). Fast-forward, I moved to New York, shifted to doing freelance, then moved to San Francisco (where I am now).

As a passionate self-learner, I started pushing harder these last couple years on learning computer systems and how to interact with them better. After switching full-time to a tmux+vim CL workflow, becoming friends with man pages, and using scripts & cheatsheets for `ack` flags and DNS record types, a curious thing happened: I magically went from being an intermediate developer to being a junior developer.

I am now circling back to my original friends, HTML, CSS, and JS, and learning how to make them interact with the new friends. In addition to firming up JavaScript basics, I've started digging into Node and python. A small current project involves publishing a script to report on which dependency managers and build tools are present in the current project, along with an optional list of the overall project's top-level dependenies.

My paid work in the last couple years is varied, but falls into categories of either medium-to-large scale marketing websites or JavaScript application work. (A portfolio of agency work is available upon request). Here are a few examples:

- created an Angular app that allows users to generate an animated gif with their own photos. Angular controlled the overall app, a component was used for cropping capabilities, and gif.js handled the canvas-to-animated gif conversion.

- built a front-end for a credit union's ATM finder (Google Maps integration) with geolocation services.

- replaced an existing Cordova app's JSON-RPC consumption with a REST consumption of a different company's back-end. It was a rush job, and I successfully submitted the switched-over app to the Apple App Store in time.

My family of websites is getting off the ground (yea!). I have separate names, domain set-ups, designs/aesthetic, content, and social media for different areas of my interest and work:

- Polyambidextrous - frontispiece; aggregate (sorry, not quite ready!)
- [Sinistrocular] - photography, especially of birds
  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scolopacid)
  - [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sinistrocular)
- Cyan-Eyed Vireo - music
  - [SoundCloud]
- [Sunflower Sea Star] - the technical side of things (this site)
  - [LinkedIn]
  - [Twitter]
  - [Github]
- [The Anti-Authority] - future home of an unneeded dictionary

My other interests include speedcubing, poetry, armchair philosophy, sometimes pinball, and more birds. Since moving to SF from NY, I've been having fun trying to learn to surf. I prefer open knowledge, reality checks, and optimism to negativity, pretense, and opacity.

I find tremendous inspiration from others across the web, and I would like to say thanks to those who operate on a high level and share & contribute so much with the online community. I would like to send an extra layer of thanks to those who lack arrogance, promote inclusivity, and foster positivity.
