Welcome. Thank you for visiting this site. ☺︎ My name is Grant Surratt, and I'm a web developer in San Francisco. I have a hungry brain and a decent WPM, so computers are a comfortable fit. My core background is front-end, and I use my family of websites as an explorations into adjacent areas: server setup and configuration, design, social integration, etc.
